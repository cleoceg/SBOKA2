        'Risk is defined as an uncertain event that can affect the objectives of a project and may contribute to its success or failure. Risks with a potential for positive impact on the project are called opportunities, whereas threats are risks that could negatively impact a project. Managing risk must be done proactively, and it is an iterative process that should begin at project inception and continue throughout the life of the project. The process of managing risk should follow some standardized steps to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated, and a proper course of action is determined and acted upon accordingly.',
        'Risks should be identified, assessed, and responded to based primarily on two factors: the probability of an occurrence and the probable impact in the event of the occurrence. Risks with high probability and high impact rating should be addressed before those with a lower rating. In general, once a risk is identified, it is important to understand the basic aspects of the risk with regard to the possible causes, the area of uncertainty, and the potential effects if the risk occurs.'

In the case of a risk, a plan B may be formulated, which can be used as a fall-back in case the risk materializes—such a plan B is a reactive response. Sometimes risks are accepted and are an example of a risk response which is neither proactive nor reactive. Risks are accepted because of various reasons, as in a situation where the probability or impact of the risk is too low for a response. ',
