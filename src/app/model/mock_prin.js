        'Scrum principles are the foundation on which the Scrum framework is based. The principles of Scrum can be applied to any type of project or organization, and they must be adhered to in order to ensure appropriate application of Scrum. The aspects and processes of Scrum can be modified to meet the requirements of the project, or the organization using it, but Scrum principles are non-negotiable and must be applied as described in the framework presented in A Guide to the Scrum Body of Knowledge (SBOK™ Guide).',
        'Keeping the principles intact and using them appropriately instills confidence to the user of the Scrum framework with regard to attaining the objectives of the project. Principles are considered to be the core guidelines for applying the Scrum framework.',
        '<b>Principles</b>, as defined in the SBOK™ Guide, are applicable to the following:',
        '•	Portfolios, programs, and/or projects in any industry',
        '•	Products, services, or any other results to be delivered to stakeholders',
        '•	Projects of any size or complexity',
        'The term “product” in the SBOK™ Guide may refer to a product, service, or other deliverable. Scrum can be applied effectively to any project in any industry—from small projects or teams with as few as six team members to large, complex projects with up to several hundred team members.'
